of English Text, PDF creation, Barcode Scanning and SQLite storage of scanned history.

The language used for describing various details on a product wrapper or cover is English. This makes it difficult for many customers to read product details as they have difficulty to read and understand English. This project is aimed at solving this problem.
With this Android application called Decipher, we aim at solving the problem which people encounter when they go to buy any product from the market and fail to read and understand the details given on a product cover; or forget to save the Shopping history for later reference
